# ARCHITECTUE
A recipe hold a list of ingredients, ingredients hold nutritional information about themselves.
The information from the ingredients can be used to calculate the nutrition for the whole recipe.

# MISC STUFF
Nutrition stuff I care about: calories, protein, fiber, fat
Serving size issues: oz vs grams, some things like eggs are weird

Store ingredients as JSON for now, probably use something like sqlite in the future
Or maybe store as bytes?
